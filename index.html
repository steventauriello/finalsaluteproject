        <h2>What Is the Final Salute Project?</h2>
        <p>
          The Final Salute Project is a veteran-focused initiative that provides handcrafted wooden keepsake
          crates to recently retired service members. Each crate is built to hold medals, patches, photos,
          and personal items — a durable, meaningful place to preserve a lifetime of service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every crate is crafted by hand, one at a time, with attention to detail and respect for the veteran’s
          story. Many of these crates start their life as Freedom Crate Co. ammo boxes, then are customized
          specifically for each veteran.
        </p>

<!-- OUR STORY -->
<section id="our-story" class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      The idea for <strong>The Final Salute Project</strong> began with a simple conversation between friends —
      one of them a Marine who had just retired. He mentioned wanting a special box to hold his medals,
      patches, and photos — something sturdy and meaningful, built to last. That conversation sparked an idea
      that would grow into a mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      We soon realized that veterans everywhere share that same desire — to keep their stories close.
      Some display their service proudly, while others keep those memories tucked away in a quiet space.
      Whether it represents the best years of their lives or memories they choose to keep private, every veteran
      deserves a way to preserve their journey with honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s why we build boxes — not hats, or belts, or t-shirts — but handcrafted wooden keepsake crates.
      Each one is a tribute to service, designed to hold the memories, medals, and mementos that define a lifetime
      of dedication. It’s a tangible way to say <em>thank you</em> — a final salute to the men and women who served.
